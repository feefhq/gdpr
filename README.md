## Overview

This project will provide a set of simple tools and templates to help with GDPR compliance. It's primarily targetted towards micro-businesses based in the UK, who want to ensure GDPR compliance with minimal fuss.

The content is provided as a means to understand and apply the core concepts and requirements of data protection legislation. I consider it to be well-informed, and is based largely on my experience of GDPR implementation at a fast-growing SME. I've kept things deliberately simple, so that they are easy to understand. If it helps you to get from having nothing to something, that's great ‚Äî¬†but if you feel the need to go beyond the basics, then you'll better off employing an expert in the field.

## Resources
