## Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing to this project! I'm really happy you found yourself here, and I'm eager for contributors to share their ideas.

If you're savvy with GitHub and the world of open-source software (OSS), I'd really appreciate your suggestions for improvements or additions, which you can submit via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/feefhq/gdpr/issues).

If you've arrived here, and your background is less technical, well don't be shy! Head over to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/feefhq/gdpr/issues) anyway; it'll take you no time at all to get signed up to GitHub, and you can jump in with both feet by submitting a new issue!

As the need arises, this file will be updated to include more info on contributing.
